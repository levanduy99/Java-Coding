## Aarray
1. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It dose not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra menory.

2. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

You are given an integer array `price` where `price[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i_th` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

3. Rotate Array

Given an array, rorate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

4. Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

5. Single Number 

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

5. Intersection of Two Arrays II

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.

## Math
1. Fizz Buzz

Given an integer `n`, return *a string array* `answer` (**1-indexed**) where:
- `answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if `i` is divisible by `3` and `5`.
- `answer[i] == "Fizz"` if `i` is divisible by `3`.
- `answer[i] == "Buzz"` if `i` is divisible by `5`.
- `answer[i] == i` if non of the above conditions are true.

2. Count Primes

Given an integer `n`, return *the number of prime number that are strictly less* than `n`.
