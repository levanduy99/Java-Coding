## Aarray
1. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It dose not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra menory.

2. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

You are given an integer array `price` where `price[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i_th` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

3. Rotate Array

Given an array, rorate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

4. Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.
